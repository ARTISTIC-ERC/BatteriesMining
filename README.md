BatteriesMining
========================================================



BatteriesMining is an text mining tool which allows to determine if certain electrodes/cells features are reported in scientific articles for both Lithium- and Sodium-ion batteries and to calculate, throughout the Shannon Entropy, the complexity to recover them. Furthermore, it enables to classify the values associated to these keywords to either exact or range of values.

Please, do not hesitate to discover the team of researchers behind the library and also the ARTISTIC project involved : [ARTISTIC](https://www.u-picardie.fr/erc-artistic/?L=0)


Setup
========================================================
We ask you to get a virtual environment such as **conda**. Go to their webpage and [download](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)
it. All dependencies will be installed on your environment.

Note that you need to follow the way below to install BatteriesMining :

1. Be sure you have the Python version 3.7.
2. Following Python libraries used to be already installed : tika, nltk, pdfminer.
3. Download all necessary ressources from nltk. Open a Python shell and launch these commands :

```python
import nltk
nltk.download()
```
Then click on 'download' inside the installation window.

From this starting point, you can install the package with the setup.py :

1. Clone the repository
2. Open a terminal into the directory at the root where the **setup.py** file is located,
and launch :

```python
python setup.py install
```

Make sure all libraries required are installed with the right version.
In the case python errors occur, please upgrade the packages indicated by :


```python
pip install --upgrade [name_of_package]
```
or
```python
python -m pip install --upgrade [name_of_package]
```

Testing dependencies
========================================================

To use tika library properly, you need to get Java 7+ installed on your system. If you meet connexion's issues for tika server (especially with Windows), please download manually a tika-server.jar file. YOu can download an example like :
``tika-server-1.19.jar``. then open Git bash and launch in your working folder :
```
java -jar tika-server-1.19.1.jar
```

A disconnected server is now running. You can now launch again your code for the extraction of PDF.
